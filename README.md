# Collaborative Journal Project
### Created as part of the WebDev @ GT club

## Description
The Collaborative Journal Project is a dynamic web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that enables users to create, manage, and collaborate on digital journals. Designed to foster creativity and enhance collaborative writing, this application provides an engaging platform where users can express their thoughts, document experiences, and share insights with others.

## Key Features:
- Account Creation & Login: Users can sign up and log into the platform.
- Journal Management: Once logged in, users can see all their journals, create new ones, or join existing journals.
- Author View: Users can access an author's view where they can add new pages, edit content, and navigate through the journal.
- Visitor View: Users can switch to a visitor's view to browse the journal without editing capabilities.
  
## Tech Stack
- Front-End: React
- Back-End: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Other Tools: Mongoose for MongoDB interaction, bcrypt for password hashing
